DocumentAtion
Welcome to the Breaking Bad API! This documentation should supply with you all the information you need to start making your HTTP requests. Give our documentation a read before you get started on your project, and don't forget about the ice trays!

All New -- Better Call Saul Data! Check out the new additions to characters, episodes, and quotes associated to the Vince Gilligan spin-off series. Since this show is currently airing, I have decided to leave out the deaths (for now).

Rate Limit
This API is free, I have no intention of creating authentication. However, to prevent harmful activity, there is a rate limit of 10,000 requests a day. If you happen to reach that limit, you will receive a 429 status code, and regain access after 24 hours.
